Pulling Out Best From Worst !! Want to Know how? 

Before Corona :

How I came into a world of Technologies and computers?

Frontend (UI) attracted me to know about how beautiful Applications are designed and Backend i.e abstracted from me has excited me i.e. how the applications are developed and started pulling me into the computers world and it has taught me the power of computers.


When Corona Started:

The Journey of Learning Multiple Technologies started here From C 
That has taught me how every bit was handled and stored on RAM and Then started learning C++, Java, Python and differences and Advantages of those Languages.
From there started multiple technologies:
HTML, CSS, JS, MYSQL, PHP ,DSA, Flask, Android, AR(ARCore,basic Unity functionality), ML , Deep Learning, Artifical Neural Network, Convolution Neural Network, Datascience , Reactjs , Nodejs, Blockchain, Networking, Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Openshift,Jenkins Azure,GCP(Google Cloud Platform),AWS, XML, Nosql, Linux...
And still going on.....

Few technologies I might have basic Knowledge But I am having confidence in Working in any of these technologies.

And Now working in TCS

So never give up and move on in Life and Learn while you go on in life.
